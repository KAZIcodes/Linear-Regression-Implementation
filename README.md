# Regression Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implementing various regression optimization techniques. Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model relationships between variables and make predictions based on observed data. The dataset is loaded, analyzed, cleaned, and used for linear regression using gradient descent and Newton's methods.

## PHASE 1: Data Analysis

### 1.1 Loading the Dataset

The dataset, which consists of multiple data points with various features, is imported and stored in a structured format (such as a table) for further analysis. This step ensures that the data is accessible for further processing.

### 1.2 Dataset Information and Missing Values

A preliminary check is conducted to assess the dataset's structure, which includes the number of rows (data points) and columns (features). Missing values refer to the absence of data in certain fields, which can affect analysis accuracy. Identifying and handling missing data is crucial to maintaining the quality of the dataset.

### 1.3 Outliers and Data Distribution Visualization

Outliers are extreme values that deviate significantly from other observations. Detecting them is important because they can distort statistical analyses. Data visualization techniques such as boxplots (which show data distribution and highlight outliers) and histograms (which display the frequency distribution of numerical values) are used to understand the overall structure of the dataset.

### 1.4 Correlation Analysis

Correlation measures the relationship between two numerical variables. A correlation matrix is a table that shows correlation coefficients, which range from -1 to 1. A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive relationship, while a value close to -1 indicates a strong negative relationship. Identifying these relationships helps in feature selection and model building.

## PHASE 2: Data Preprocessing

### 2.1 Handling Missing Values

Missing data points can be addressed through:

- **Removal**: Eliminating rows or columns with missing values (if their absence does not affect the analysis significantly).
- **Imputation**: Replacing missing values with estimates, such as the mean, median, or mode of the available data.

### 2.2 Encoding Categorical Variables

Categorical variables (e.g., "Male" or "Female") need to be converted into numerical values so that they can be used in mathematical models. One-hot encoding is a technique that converts categorical values into a series of binary (0 or 1) variables.

### 2.3 Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new variables from existing data to enhance model performance. For example, combining two features (e.g., "height" and "weight") into a new feature (e.g., "BMI") can provide additional insights for the model.

### 2.4 Handling Outliers (IQR Method)

The Interquartile Range (IQR) method is used to detect and remove extreme values. The IQR is the range between the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3) of the data. Any value outside 1.5 times the IQR from Q1 or Q3 is considered an outlier and may be removed or adjusted.

### 2.5 Normalization

Normalization ensures that all numerical values are on a similar scale, preventing any one feature from dominating the analysis. MinMax scaling is a technique that scales data to a fixed range (e.g., 0 to 1) to standardize the input for regression models.

### 2.6 Splitting the Data

The dataset is divided into two parts:

- **Training Set**: Used to train the model by learning patterns in the data.
- **Testing Set**: Used to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data.
A typical split is 80% training and 20% testing.

## PHASE 3: Implementing Regression Models

### 3.1 Cost Function

A cost function quantifies the difference between the predicted and actual values. In regression, the cost function is often Mean Squared Error (MSE), which calculates the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

### 3.2 Gradient Descent Implementation

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that minimizes the cost function by iteratively adjusting model parameters. It calculates the gradient (slope) of the cost function and updates the model's weights in the direction that reduces the error.

### 3.3 Newton's Methods

Newton’s method is another optimization technique that, unlike gradient descent, uses second-order derivatives to find the optimal values more quickly. It converges faster than gradient descent in some cases but requires more computational power.

## PHASE 4: Model Evaluation

### 4.1 Evaluating Model Performance

To measure how well the regression model fits the data, performance metrics are used:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better model performance.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables. A value closer to 1 indicates a better model fit.

### 4.2 Plotting Cost History

The cost history plot shows how the cost function decreases over multiple iterations, helping to visualize the model's learning process. A decreasing cost function indicates that the model is optimizing correctly.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the complete process of regression analysis, from loading and preprocessing data to implementing and evaluating regression models. By comparing gradient descent and Newton’s methods, we gain insights into their efficiency in optimizing regression models. This workflow is essential for building predictive models in data science and machine learning applications.
